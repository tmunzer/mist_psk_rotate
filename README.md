## How it works?
1. The script will retrieve the WLAN configuration (it can be a SITE Wlan or an ORG Wlan)
2. The script will will generate a new PSK for the WLAN. The PSK strength can be configured.
3. The script will update the WLAN configuration.
4. If configured, the script will send the new PSK to the administrator(s)

## How to use it?
1. Just install the dependencies manually or with the `requirements.txt` file. For example with `p√Æp -r requirements.txt`.
2. Then configure the `.env` file (an example can be found in the `example.env` file).
3. And to finish start the script with `python mist_psk_rotate.py` or `python3 mist_psk_rotate.py` depending on your system

## Configuration
### Script settings
Check the `example.env` file to know how to configure the script. You will have to create a `.env` file with the required settings.

By default, the script is looking for the `.env` file in its own directory. You can also pass the `.env` file location when running the script with the `-e` option (i.e. `python3 mist_psk_rotate.py -e <path to the env file>`).

You can use the `-c` option to check your configuration.

### Email template
**Any change in the `psk_template.html` is at your own risks!**

If you want to customize the email sent to the users, you can modify the `psk_template.html` file. It's basicaly a HTML file, but:
- Be sure to use double curly brackets "{{" and "}}" instead of single curly brackets for HTML
- The script will inject 3 information in the template:
  - `{0}` will be replaced by the logo image location. It must be published on a web server and reachable by the users' devices
  - `{1}` will be replaced by the SSID name
  - `{2}` wll be replaced by the PPSK value
  - If QRcode is enabled, `{3}` wll be replaced by the QRCode information (i.e. "You can also scan the QRCode below to configure your device:")
  - If QRcode is enabled, `{4}` wll be replaced by the QRCode
